"""The vendor's half of support — screens 1g (inbox) and 1h (thread).

Every view here is scoped by OrganisationMixin: the queryset starts from
`Ticket.objects.for_organisation(...)`, so a reference belonging to another
vendor simply is not in it and resolves as a 404. That is deliberate — a 403
would confirm the ticket exists, and a reference is guessable.

State never moves in this module. `post_reply()` and `record_status_change()`
in the model layer own that, so the inbox, the Staff console and the admin all
move a ticket the same way.

htmx is layered on top and nothing depends on it: each action keeps a real
`action=` and answers a plain POST with a redirect back to the thread.
