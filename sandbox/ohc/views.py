"""The OHC team's console: the support queue, the vendor register, and events.

Every view here inherits OhcConsoleMixin, and OhcConsoleMixin exists to make the
gate impossible to forget: it is StaffConsoleMixin plus the shell's active
nav item, so there is no way to add a screen to this app without the check. That
gate is the security boundary of the whole feature — a signed-in vendor who
guesses a URL under /ohc/ is looking at every other vendor's tickets — so it is
also asserted route by route in tests/test_views.py.

State is never written here. post_reply() and record_status_change() own what a
reply and a move mean, and Organisation.set_verification() owns what verifying a
vendor means; the views collect the input and call them.
